Two Phase Commit Protocol

The protocol makes the following assumptions about each transaction T:
	
	Transaction T accesses resources from time to time. If it terminates normally without any errors, it issues a commit.
	
	If it experiences a serious error at any time, such as a deadlock or illegal operation, it issues an abort operation.
	
	In response to the commit, the system runs the two-phase commit protocol.
	
	Each cohort has a transaction recovery system

	One and only one program issues the commit operation on T.
		In some cases, a second attempt to run two-phase commit while the first attempt is still running will cause the protocol to break

	The protocol does not make mistakes when a system or a cohort malfunctions.
		It either does exactly what the protocol says it should do, or it stops running.

	    It is possible for a failure to cause the protocol to do something that is inconsistent with its specification, such as sending bogus messages. These are called Byzantine failures.
