The Protocol

Phase 1

To commit the transaction, the coordinator starts by sending a PREPARE message to each participant.

The coordinator waits for all participants to “vote” on the request.

In response to receiving a PREPARE message, each participant votes by sending a message back to the coordinator, as follows:
	It votes PREPARED if it is prepared to commit.

It may vote NO for any reason, usually because it cannot prepare the transaction due to a local failure.

It may delay voting indefinitely, for example, because its system is overburdened with other work or because it failed.
















Phase 2

If the coordinator receives PREPARED messages from all participants, it decides to commit. 
	The transaction is now officially committed. 
	Otherwise, it either received a NO message or gave up waiting for some participant, so it decides to abort.

The coordinator sends its decision to all participants - COMMIT or ABORT.

Participants acknowledge receipt of the commit or abort by replying DONE.
	After receiving DONE from all participants, the coordinator can forget the transaction.
	It can deallocate any memory it was using to keep track of information about the transaction.
