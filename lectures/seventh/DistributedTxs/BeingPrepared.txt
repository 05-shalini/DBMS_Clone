Being Prepared


A participant P is said to be prepared if all of transaction Tâ€™s after-images at P are in stable storage.
	It is essential that T does not commit at any participant until all participants are	 prepared.


Ensuring that all participants are prepared before any of them commits is the essence of two-phase commit.

	Phase one is when all participants become prepared. Phase two is when they commit. No participant enters.
	
	Phase two until all participants have completed phase one; that is, until all participants are prepared.
