Introduction

A cohort that processed some of T’s updates fails after T has been committed at another cohort.

A cohort that failed while T was committing has now recovered and wants to find out whether T committed or recovered. 
	How does it know who to ask? 
	What should it do if none of the other cohort that processed T’s operations are up and running?

What if a cohort R is not responding to messages?
	Should other cohorts assume R is down, and therefore its active transactions will abort, or 
	that communications is down and R is still operational?

As in DBMS recovery, application programmers usually do not get involved in two-phase commit.
	Most database systems and transactional middleware support it and make it transparent to the application.
